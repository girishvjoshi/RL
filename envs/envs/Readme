Environments Implemented.

1)GridWorld
2)Acrobot
3)Quadrotor

The example implementation of each environemtn is provided in jupyter notebook. The render option only works on IDE and not
in jupyter notebook code.

Part 3) Enviroment of choice: I have implemented the 6DOF qudrotor model. The agent should learn to stabalize the quad.
Trajectory tracking (outer loop control can be implemented) in that case innner loop attitude control will be done using PID.
